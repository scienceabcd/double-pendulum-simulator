# double-pendulum-simulator
This is a simulation of a double pendulum. You can drag and drop the double pendulum. It also includes air resistance as well.
The reason I made this was to simulate the hard, complex physics of the double pendulum. I wanted to see what would happen if I drop it at a high or low height to see what will happen and how. In the code, there is a blue background and two yellow balls of the pendulum.
